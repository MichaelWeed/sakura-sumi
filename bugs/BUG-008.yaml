description: |
  The web application does not have a favicon.ico file, causing the browser to request /favicon.ico and receive a 404 error. This appears in the browser console and may cause minor performance impact.

steps_to_reproduce:
  - "Step 1: Navigate to http://localhost:5001"
  - "Step 2: Open browser developer console"
  - "Step 3: Observe console errors"

expected_behavior: |
  The application should either have a favicon.ico file or suppress the 404 error.

actual_behavior: |
  Browser console shows: "Failed to load resource: the server responded with a status of 404 (NOT FOUND) @ http://localhost:5001/favicon.ico:0"

  root_cause: "Missing favicon link in HTML head section"
  solution: "Added inline SVG favicon using data URI with sakura emoji (🌸) to match the application theme"

notes: |
  This is a minor cosmetic issue that doesn't affect functionality but should be fixed for a polished user experience. Can be resolved by either:
  1. Adding a favicon.ico file to the static directory
  2. Adding a <link rel="icon"> tag pointing to an existing icon
  3. Suppressing the 404 in Flask configuration
